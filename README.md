# Word-suggestion program
This is a word-suggestion program using trie as the main data structure. Right now the suggestion feature is primitive, mainly:
- Doesn't have auto entering, have to press Enter manually to have a suggestion
- Alphabetical order to suggests words instead of words's popularity.
- Cannot suggest words that has xxx prefix or yyy suffix.
- Cannot limit the length of the suggested words.
- Using console as the output log.
